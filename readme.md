# JavaScript30

I'm working through the Javascript30 class Wes Bos offers to up my ES6 game. You can access the course at [https://JavaScript30.com](https://JavaScript30.com).

## Why use this repo and not Wes'?

Bos includes all answers with his starter code. I'm trying to complete each exercise using ES5 stuff I know well, taking a shot at doing it in ES6 and then watching the videos to supplement what I'm doing.

For each of the 30 lessons, I'm creating a branch that tracks my work `01`, `02`, etc. Feel free to check them out one by one.
